🎓 PhD from EPFL since 2025 | 🧠 Neuroscientist | 💻 Data-Driven Innovator

I’m passionate about studying motor control and adaptation using advanced neuroengineering techniques. 
I recently graduated from Mackenzie Mathis’ Laboratory at EPFL, where I spearheaded cutting-edge VR setups for mice and study the neural mechanisms underlying visuomotor adaptation.

Currently, I am teaching an applied AI full semester course at [IFAGE - by ImpactAI](https://www.ifage.ch/formation/tic/intelligence-artificielle/developpeur-dintelligence-artificielle-appliquee/?attribute_pa_session=s-00903), guiding students through real-world AI projects.

🔬 My work involves:

- 🧑‍💻 Programming: Python, C#, C++, React, Nodejs
- 🧠 Neuroscience research: Optogenetics, neural circuits, behavioral analysis
- 🎮 Virtual Reality development for neuroscience applications
- 📊 Advanced data analysis and machine learning
