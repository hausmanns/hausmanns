🎓 PhD Candidate @ EPFL | 🧠 Neuroscientist | 💻 Data-Driven Innovator

I’m passionate about studying motor control and adaptation using advanced neuroengineering techniques. 
I rencently graduated from Mackenzie Mathis’ Laboratory at EPFL, where I spearheaded cutting-edge VR setups for mice and study the neural mechanisms underlying visuomotor adaptation.

🔬 My work involves:

- 🧑‍💻 Programming: Python, C#, C++, and more
- 🧠 Neuroscience research: Optogenetics, neural circuits, behavioral analysis
- 🎮 Virtual Reality development for neuroscience applications
- 📊 Advanced data analysis and machine learning
